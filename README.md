# EndToEnd-Feature-Engineering-Model
ðŸš€ End-to-End Feature Engineering &amp; Model Project: A learning-focused project demonstrating data preprocessing, feature extraction, and basic model development. Covers essential techniques for cleaning, transforming, and preparing data for machine learning.  I developed it for learning. Let me know if you'd like any modifications! ðŸ”¥

# Titanic Feature Engineering

## Overview
This project involves feature engineering on the Titanic dataset to improve predictive modeling. The dataset is processed using Python, with an emphasis on handling missing values, creating new features, and encoding categorical variables.

## Features Engineered
- **Title Extraction**: Extracts passenger titles from names.
- **Family Size**: Combines `SibSp` and `Parch` to create a new feature.
- **Cabin Information**: Extracts deck level from the `Cabin` column.
- **Age Imputation**: Fills missing age values based on title groups.
- **Fare Binning**: Categorizes `Fare` into discrete groups.
- **Embarked Imputation**: Fills missing values for `Embarked`.

## Requirements
Ensure you have the following installed:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Usage
Run the script to preprocess the Titanic dataset:

```bash
python titanic_feature_engineering.py
```

## Dataset
- The dataset can be found on [Kaggle's Titanic Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data).

## Results
- The transformed dataset is saved for further model training.
- Improved predictive power by engineering meaningful features.
